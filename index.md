## Research

### VR Twin for Troubleshooting Lunar-based Assembly Failures (2020-2022)

<div style="text-align: left;">
  NASA will return to the Moon to conduct lunar and space science and prepare for human exploration missions. NASA's current rover failure response methods use hardware duplicates which are costly and time consuming to assemble. To address this, we developed and assessed a VR digital rover twin in a simulated environment using novel technologies to support lunar robotic missions, like <a href="https://www.lpi.usra.edu/leag/white-papers-astronomy/FARSIDE_190710_Final.pdf">FARSIDE</a>.<br>

### Free Induction Decay Frequency Extraction Engine (2021-2022)

  Current methods for measuring the magnetic field produced by the brain are expensive and cumbersome. FieldLine Inc. has developed a magnetometer that does not require the use of shielded rooms and can provide data in real-time. For our senior design project, we created a frequency extraction engine to be used with our sponsor's Free Induction Decay magnetometers. See our project <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/ecee/fid-frequency-extraction-engine"> here </a>.
