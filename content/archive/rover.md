The [University Rover Challenge](https://urc.marssociety.org/) is a yearly competition hosted by the Mars Society and held in Hanksville, Utah with the aim to promote human exploration and settlement on Mars.
This competition specifically focuses on rovers that could possibly one day assist astronauts on the Martian surface. This multi-day event is composed of four missions that bring many aspects of engineering, biology, and geology together to design the best and most most capable rover! 

I presided the CU Rover Team after leading electrical subteam to build a rover to assist astronauts on the Martian surface for the University Rover Challenge. This included leading a 21-student team to design and build a drive base. I also secured new sponsors in 2021-22 with a value of 19,800$. Additionally, I Developed firmware for the MSP432 microcontroller to expose telemetry and control hooks to ROS via rosbridge as well as designed the club website.
