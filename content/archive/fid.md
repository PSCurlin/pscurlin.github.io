Current methods for measuring the magnetic field produced by the brain are expensive and cumbersome. FieldLine Inc. has developed a magnetometer that does not require the use of shielded rooms and can provide data in real-time. For our senior design project, we created a frequency extraction engine to be used with our sponsor's Free Induction Decay magnetometers. See our project [here](https://www.colorado.edu/ecee/fid-frequency-extraction-engine).
