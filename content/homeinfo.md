I am a 3rd year PhD student in Electrical Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder under the supervision of [Prof. Tamara Silbergleit Lehman](https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/lehmantamara/). My research focuses on creating and implementing security metrics for computer hardware systems.

I obtained, at the University of Colorado Boulder, my MSc in Electrical Engineering in 2024 and my BSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2022. During my undergraduate degree, I researched applications of VR/AR to lunar robotics under the guidance of [Prof. Jack O. Burns](https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/burns/).

I also interned at Apple in Cupertino, CA over the summer of 2024 where I worked with the CoreOS â€“ Vector & Numerics group to accelerate machine learning.
