Current methods for measuring the magnetic field produced by the brain are expensive and cumbersome.
FieldLine Inc. has developed a magnetometer targeted towards such applications that does not require the use
of shielded rooms and can provide data in real-time. For our senior design project, we designed and created a frequency extraction engine 
to be used with  our sponsor's, FieldLine Inc.'s Free Induction Decay magnetometers.
